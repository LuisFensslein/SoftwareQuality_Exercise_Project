# SoftwareQuality_Exercise_Project

This Project is solely used for demonstration purposes. Therefore the code (located in [src](src)) is only a very basic example that can be used to calculate easy mathematical operations (plus, minus, multiply, divide) of two integers. Also, the following contents of this file are not intended to represent a fully-fledged readme.

## Math Script

The script uses Java.

> The script has been successfully tested on Windows 11.

## Installation

Please clone this repository.

## Testing

The [test_Math.java](src/test_Math.java) script can be used to test the functionality of the [Math.java](src/Math.java) script. Please be aware that the tests require the JUnit framework (tested with JUnit 4).
