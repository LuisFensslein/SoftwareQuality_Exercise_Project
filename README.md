# SoftwareQuality_Exercise_Project

This Project is solely used for demonstration purposes. Therefore the code (located in [src](src)) is only a very basic example that can be used to calculate easy mathematical operations (plus, minus, multiply, divide) of two integers. Also, the following contents of this file are not intended to represent a fully-fledged readme.
